# TasteBreaker
Everybody has a their go-to music app that they enjoy using to play their favorite tunes.
As an avid  Spotify user, I was inspired to create a rendition of Spotify, which I named TasteBreaker, 
in order to expose the user to new song recommendations.
This app was created in Android Studio, where I used XML and Java to design the apps layout, upload and add various album covers/artists music, and create an interactive interface for the user 
to explore music.

Folders: Everything is found mostly by navigating the 'src' file.
tastebreaker - implemented in Java, is the functionality of each UI layout for each genre, including the apps homescreen.
Res - contains uploaded songs for the four of my faovrite genres: Lofi, hip hop, rock, and oldies. I used Java to implement the songs into TasteBreaker.
Drawable folder - contains album covers of all artists uploaded to TasteBreaker
Layout - programmed in XML, this contains code used to create the UI layout of each genre within TasteBreaker as well as the apps home screen UI layout. 
Raw - contains the uploads of mp3 songs of the artists

This was the project that inspired me to want to pursure UI design. Thank you for reading this far!
